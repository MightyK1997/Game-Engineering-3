What are the controls for the locally controlled unit?

What workflow enhancement did you implement in the editor?
The only enhancement i made to the editor is to add UI for Island editor by adding slider to increase or decrease the size of the
island

Any other comments?
1. All the ability details are dynamically loaded from JSON files, which can be modified easily.
2. The level of each upgrade for the abilities is stored in another JSON file, which is then used to load the appropriate data
from the ability JSON files.
3. This results in having a system that can contain more than 3 upgrades and can be easily scaled to multiple abilities and items.
4. Had to change the rendering mode of material from default to transparent, so that stealth can be used.
